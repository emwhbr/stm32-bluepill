OpenOCD, ST-LINK and fake STM32

  flash:      131072 (pagesize: 1024)
  sram:       20480
  chipid:     0x0410
  descr:      F1xx Medium-density

The reported chipid (0x0410) looks like a genuine STM32 (STM32F103C8T6).
But the reported flash size (128KB) is bigger than the expected size (64KB).
And when using STlink GUI, the reported CoreId is 0x2ba01477, but a genuine
chip shall report a value of 0x1ba01477. We have identified a fake STM32!!!

But all is not lost. We can still use OpenOCD with ST-LINK by using some magic.

stm32f1x-fake.cfg

This file is a copy of openocd/share/openocd/scripts/target/stm32f1x.cfg.
Replace the following line:
   set _CPUTAPID 0x1ba01477
with the one below:
   set _CPUTAPID 0x2ba01477

Copy this file to OpenOCD installation directory:
   sudo cp stm32f1x-fake.cfg /opt/openocd/share/openocd/scripts/target/

Now OpenOCD will be happy and can be started with:
   openocd -f interface/stlink-v2.cfg -f target/stm32f1x-fake.cfg
